## Milestone: Project Zero (2026-02-24)
- All previous code, GitHub history, and project files deleted.
- Environment reset to absolute zero.
- Transitioned to Scrum/Sprint workflow (Sprint 1: The Awakening).

## Key Decisions
- High-Tier Model Enforcement: No legacy models (4o etc.) allowed.

- Subagents will operate as independent entities reporting back to this group.

## Sprint 1 Goals
- [ ] Initialize GitHub Repo (robowar-v2)
- [ ] Configure Vercel Deployment Pipeline
- [ ] Setup Jira Scrum Board (ID: 1) and Sprint 1
- [ ] Create Project Scaffold (FE/BE/Engine)
